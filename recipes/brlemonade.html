    Not only are the ingredients simple, but Brazilian lemonade is super easy to make as well! 
    It is also great for making big batches of.<br>
    It is a potluck favorite! Just a few minutes is all it takes to blend the ingredients together and you have a perfect, refreshing, summer lemonadeâ€¦. or limeade.<br>
    I hope someday I will find the answer to this!
